The-I2P-Applications
====================

Introduction
------------

When you install the I2P router as made available at [geti2p.net](https://geti2p.net/en/download),
you are actually installing an I2P router and an accompanying bundle of about a
dozen basic applications. These are all made available to the user via a webUI,
which listens at [127.0.0.1:7657](http://127.0.0.1:7657), and the main page of
which is called the "Router Console," where you monitor the health of all the
applications that are using I2P and navigate I2P configuration, control, and
feedback. This document, in order of significance to the new user, attempts to
elucidate the relationship between I2P, Applications Internal to I2P, and
Applications External to I2P, without going into too much detail about the areas
in-between.
